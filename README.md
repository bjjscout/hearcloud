Hearcloud
============

##About the project

Heardcloud is a web application that lets you effortlessly store all your music files and make them availabe anytime and everywhere you want. You can organize your songs inside the platform, editing all their attributes (like title, artists, artwork, ...) and download the updated files again to your system.

## Why did I start this project?

Since music is one of my passions, I found that I had a bunch of songs distributed on a wide range of devices  (desktop computer, laptop, hdds, pen drives, smartphone, tablets, etc) which were also in general duplicated. Because of that, I felt I needed something that would let me store all of them in one place where I could also organise my collection, editing their tags and making them available whenever I want to play or download again.

## Why Django?

From all the programming languages that I've studied so far, Python es the one with which I'm feeling more comftable. So, when I found Django, I immediately wanted to learn more about it.
